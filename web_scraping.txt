In this exercise, we created a Python program that performs web scraping and sentiment analysis.
We used the Beautiful Soup library to scrape a Wikipedia page about the Python programming language and extract 
the text from the paragraph ('p') tags. We then used the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on the
extracted text and displayed the polarity and subjectivity scores.
